# Based Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


### `yarn test`

## Assumptions

I ran into some technical issues around the test framework and 
react that slowed me down a bit. So, I did spend a bit over 2 hours
in the end but didn't want to "cheat" so ended up a bit behind where 
I'd have liked to be.
